    1 User Authentication:
        The user is redirected to Spotify for authentication. After they log in and authorize your app, Spotify redirects them back to your application's 
        callback URL with an authorization code.

    2 Handling the Callback:
        When the user is redirected back to your app, the URL contains an authorization code as a query parameter 
        (e.g., http://localhost:3000/callback?code=AQAGTwZNgfwEOfNvPCZduERjGGSufmpQ9J3wHRQOvLNPJCS_WsUKF78zZp-rh-cX6UI9uln6FEV9KFYKS6JC4xa3UUq-d9O7cAhmvrXbhY5UzCh6Du9a5J1e7sBgJs68RXyPpbTG3Au2fHTzXUn4LLN1JOaCTtLk2Iu5yv2oVKrV-QfCLNEHKKhE0L5ApViTldoUAvWL3hQ53WIdBZJJ5TWtiLLuaubBpVWEULOGB8cZ-pP3aTyHU8vdcXo3wQ3CVu2oa49F0y2mBlwBLWh4ohJmK2wpeD514dTM0QSDv5Y9Zykd4l4G).

    3 Extracting the Authorization Code:
        In the handleCallback function, the authorization code is extracted from the URL using URLSearchParams. This code is used to obtain an access token.

    4 Exchanging the Authorization Code:
        You send a request to Spotify’s API to exchange the authorization code for an access token. 
        The access token is then used to make authenticated requests to Spotify's API on behalf of the user.

    5 Single Use of the Authorization Code:
        The authorization code is valid only for a single exchange, which means you should use it immediately to get the access token. 
        Once the token is obtained, the authorization code is no longer needed and can be discarded.

Summary

    Authorization Code: Used once to obtain an access token.
    Access Token: Used to make authenticated API requests.

By handling the callback correctly and using the authorization code once, you ensure that your app operates securely and efficiently 
without redundant or unnecessary steps.
